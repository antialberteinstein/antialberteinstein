## 🚀 Projects

### 🥇 1. IoT Face Recognition Attendance System (AI Module)
*   **Face Recognition Pipeline:** Built using InsightFace embeddings and optimized for accuracy.
*   **Classification:** Implemented KNN-based identity classification with tuned distance thresholds for balanced precision and recall.
*   **Integration:** Exposed inference API via Flask for seamless integration with IoT-based attendance systems.

### 🥈 2. Asynchronous LLM Web System (Java + llama.cpp)
*   **Local Inference:** Integrated local LLM inference into a Java Servlet application.
*   **Async Architecture:** Designed a job queue for long-running AI tasks to ensure computation persistence beyond HTTP session lifecycles.
*   **Agent Logic:** Built custom agent logic without relying on external heavy frameworks.

### 🥉 3. Memory-Augmented AI Agent (Python)
*   **Memory Architecture:** Designed a case-based memory retrieval architecture.
*   **Context Injection:** Used ML-based similarity search to inject relevant context into prompts.
*   **Teacher Mode:** Implemented a teacher mode for journal enrichment via Gemini API.
*   **Orchestration:** Built a custom orchestration pipeline for autonomous action execution.
